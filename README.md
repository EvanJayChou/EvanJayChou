# 👋 Hi, I'm Evan Chou

🚀 Aspiring AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist | 🤖 Robotics Enthusiast | 🧠 Deep Learning Explorer

I'm an engineering student passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge AI, robotics, and the physical world. I love creating projects that combine low-level systems, CUDA programming, reinforcement learning, and real-world robotics using platforms like NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2. I am also passionate about application development with AI/ML workflows and agentic AI integration.
